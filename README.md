## Installation

To use Vagrant with VMware, you need to install three things:

Vagrant itself: You can download the appropriate installer for your operating system from the Vagrant website: https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads.

VMware utility for Vagrant: You can download the appropriate utility for your operating system from the VMware website: https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads/vmware.

VMware plugin for Vagrant: Once you have installed Vagrant and the VMware utility, you can use the following command in your terminal to install the plugin required to use VMware with Vagrant:
`vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-desktop`

Once you have installed all three components, you can proceed with setting up your Consul experiments. You can refer to the Hashicorp Consul tutorials for more information on how to do this: https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/tutorials.
